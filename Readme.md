# Project Title

Computer Security Lab Experiments
* Networking Commands
* Implementation of Product Cipher
* Assignment - File Logger

## Getting Started
* Experiment contain the document giving detail info about the network related commands.
* Product cipher requires python interpreter, Caeser cipher technique is combined with columnar transposition cipher.

### Assignments.
* A File logger implemented using PyQT5 and QTDesigner which tracks the activity of each action done by the user on BMI Calculator simply double click the .exe file to execute present inside executable directory.See the event result in .txt generated from the program serving as log files.

### Prerequisites

* Python Interpreter
* Windows OS.
